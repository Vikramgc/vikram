            data-bs-whatever="Plano Escalera abdjfh asdf dajfhd dfhajdfha fdjfh">The dust collector plant is designed to separate dust particles from the air in various manufacturing workspaces. It consists of two stages of separation. The first stage is the pre-separator, which filters out particles with a diameter of up to 5mm (such as wood chips and papers). The second stage consists of a bag filter tube, where purification is done for dust particles of 5 microns, resulting in minimal dust emission into the air.

The total components for this dust collector plant design include 2 pre-separators, 3 centrifugal fans, and 1 filter bag tube. Other components such as ducts, valves, nuts, and bolts are also included. The design is NDA-signed, so 2D and blueprint documents are kept confidential.

It was initially created in Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D printing, starting from a conceptual sketch as per the client's request. Subsequently, the model was 3D printed and then re-designed for Design for Assembly (DFA). Please note that the model does not include any wiring, electrical components, or circuit boards. 

The design consists of three main body parts: the head body, the upper mid body (connecting the head to the mid-section where all the other components are located), and the mid-section component, further divided into three bodies for ease of assembly - the four wings of the drone and the rest of the body. Lastly, there's the tail body.

The four wings connected to the mid-section are identical, each containing one propeller and one motor. Button head hex screws were used as fasteners.</p>

In collaboration with a UK-based client for research purposes, I focused on developing the physical design of the headband, which integrates crucial components like a flow sensor to monitor cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) movement and a pressure sensor to measure brain pressure. These sensors are designed to work together, providing real-time data to help manage the CFS drainage system effectively for those affected by hydrocephalus.
My contribution focused on the structural aspects of the headband while leaving the electrical wiring and coding for further development. The design thoughtfully includes space for an actuator system to adjust the shunt's pressure based on sensor inputs. Although the headband has not been tested yet, it represents a significant conceptual model for future research</p>

First, the user's leg is 3D scanned, and then the body is converted into a surface body and offset by 0.25mm to ensure a perfect fit without tightness. Next, the offset surfaces are thickened to create a solid body of uniform thickness. Autodesk Fusion 360 was used for the entire design process. Polycentric spur gears were utilized as a joint mechanism to allow smooth mobility, and the pad heights were determined through research and then extruded. Additionally, slots were incorporated for the straps.</p>

    The project's goal was to design and prototype a snow plow and blower vehicle that looks and functions like a modified version of the Holder C992, with specific adjustments to meet the client's requirements. The design was inspired by the Holder C992, known for its reliability and versatility in snow removal tasks. Detailed photos of the Holder C992 were used as a reference, and dimensions were obtained from the company's official catalog to ensure accuracy to the original design. The model was scaled down for prototyping purposes, making it easier to handle and test. This scale model will serve as a proof of concept before manufacturing the full-sized version. The interior of the vehicle was designed to be hollow to accommodate future electrical components.  The vehicle model was created using advanced surfacing techniques in SolidWorks, resulting in a smooth, aesthetically pleasing exterior that aligns with the modernized look requested by the client.

The goal of this design project was to develop a mini bike specifically for children under 13 years old, to be showcased in Wonderland. The client provided the concept and specified dimensions and materials. Cast iron was chosen for its durability and strength, ideal for the frame and other critical components. The design process started with creating the chassis. The mini bike's wheels were designed to be 3D printed, providing flexibility in size and design while keeping the bike's overall weight low. The mini bike is equipped with the Tillotson TPP-225Rs racing engine, a four-stroke engine that delivers over 15 horsepower, offering power while remaining manageable for young riders. The bike represents a carefully balanced combination of power, durability, and safety.

   		 This project focuses on designing a robust and versatile phone holder capable of accommodating devices ranging from an iPhone 5 to an iPad. The holder features adjustable clips to securely grip devices of various sizes, an adjustable angle for optimal viewing, and a movable arm for height adjustment. The design is tailored to offer flexibility and durability, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

The holder is primarily constructed using 3D-printed components, including the mid holder, base, base joint, tray holder, holding tray, and clip assemblies. The only non-printed parts are the fasteners, which include two M6 bolts and nuts acting as the axle for the adjustable angle mechanism, and eight M4 bolts paired with four M4 heat inserts. The heat inserts are embedded into the base, while the remaining M4 bolts are used for direct mounting. This design approach not only ensures a sturdy and stable structure but also allows for easy assembly and adjustment.

   		 This project involved designing a unique, adjustable-size flower pot to meet the client's requirement for a planter that can expand as the plant grows. The pot features a single opening at the top for planting, ensuring simplicity in design while accommodating the plant's need for more space over time. The innovative design allows the pot to expand from an initial diameter of 450 mm to a maximum of 550 mm, providing additional room as the plant's root system develops.

The design includes a base plate and a base plate cover, which form the foundation of the pot. The expandable structure is made up of 16 wall plates that connect with each other via rubber inserts placed between slots. This flexible connection method enables the pot to gradually expand while maintaining structural integrity. The expandable nature of the pot allows it to grow along with the plant, ensuring that it remains functional and aesthetically pleasing as the plant matures.

              Adjustable Laser Mount Design for CO2 Laser Tube
            </h3>

   		 This project focused on designing a custom mount mechanism to hold a red laser in front of a CO2 laser tube for alignment purposes. The client's requirement was to secure the mount around the body of the laser tube, rather than at the end, due to space constraints. The design needed to ensure that the centerline of the laser mount and the CO2 laser tube remained concentric for precise alignment.

The mount was designed as a two-piece hinged structure that clamps securely onto the laser tube. The mount includes 3 to 4 threaded holes to allow for fine adjustment of the laser's alignment. This ensures the laser can be precisely positioned, maintaining optimal alignment with the CO2 laser beam. The design also accounted for the specific dimensions provided by the client, with the laser tube having a diameter of 55 mm in its largest section and a reduced diameter of approximately 23 mm at the end. The mount was created in Fusion 360, adhering to the client's preference for easy future modifications.

Overall, the final design met the client's requirements, providing a practical and adjustable solution for mounting the red laser securely and accurately in front of the CO2 laser tube.

   		 In this project, I was tasked with creating a 3D model for a cube speaker inspired by the traditional Japanese "Sashimono" woodworking technique. The client sought a unique design where the cube, approximately 8.5 cm on each side, would be composed of two interlocking parts. The challenge was to ensure that the design allowed sufficient internal space to house a 7 cm speaker while also providing room for other electronic components.

The project involved careful consideration of the internal structure to securely hold the speaker in place, while maintaining the aesthetic and functional integrity of the cube. After reviewing the client's requirements and potential constraints, we agreed on a design approach that balanced the internal space with the external dimensions

   		 The universal stand was designed to accommodate both laptops and tablets, featuring adjustable height and angle, as well as collapsibility for portability. The design needed to be aesthetically pleasing and suitable for 3D printing. It consists of three main bodies: the top plate, mid holder, and base plate. There was also a weight constraint, and the design included pattern cuts for air ventilation for the laptops and tablets. The hinge and lock mechanism used a pin joint."

   		 In this project, I was approached by a client who needed modifications to an existing rose mold file that they had purchased online. The original mold had several issues, including the inability to draft properly after molding and the lack of space for a parting tool bridge. To address these concerns, I recreated the mold model in SolidWorks, conducting a thorough draft and undercut analysis to ensure proper functionality. The initial three-part mold design was re-engineered into a five-part mold, allowing for more efficient assembly and disassembly.

Screw holes were added with precise reference to the existing mold, ensuring compatibility with the client’s tooling. To further enhance the quality of the final product, a vacuum bag was employed during the prototyping phase to eliminate bubble formation. The final prototype, shown in the accompanying image, successfully utilized a fast-curing epoxy resin with a curing time of approximately two hours,

   		 For the W310 Rev B project, I designed a robust, weatherproof camera enclosure that checks all the boxes for the client's needs. The design includes two main enclosure bodies with cooling fins, a central frame that holds everything securely, and various slots and mounts to fit components like the modem, X10 sensor, and other connectors.

To ensure durability and weather resistance, the lens housing was designed with an O-ring seal, and the lid screws tightly into the enclosure to keep out the elements. The rear panel has custom-sized holes for connectors, and the internal frame mounts securely to the base from the inside after assembly, with extra fixing points for stability. The result is a solid, weatherproof enclosure that’s ready to protect the W310 Rev B camera in any environment.

   		 The Boson T21 Rev B is a compact version of the W310 Rev B camera, designed with a tighter fit due to the reduced height of the Boson sensor. The primary changes involve accommodating the smaller sensor with a T1 mount, while maintaining the overall proportions of other components.

The design features a two-part enclosure, a lens slot, a T-mount, a lens cap, a SIM cover for the modem, top inserts, and a camera mount. The slots for the modem, Boson sensor, and other connectors were customized to fit the specific requirements of the electrical parts. The result is a sleek, space-efficient enclosure that ensures a secure and functional fit for the Boson T21 Rev B camera.

	<h2>3. Understanding CNC Machining</h2>
	<p>For a visual explanation, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4jwVdFsoGo</p>
	<p>The step-by-step process of CNC machining involves:</p>
	<p>1. Creating a CAD model with specifications like tolerance, construction lines, and threads.</p>
	<p>2. Converting the CAD model into a CNC-compatible format using CAM tools such as AutoCAD or Fusion 360.</p>
	<p>3. Starting the machining process by attaching the required cutting tools.</p>
	<p>CNC machines use a microprocessor to control the tool, with G-code and M-code programming languages providing information about feed rate, spindle speed, cutting tool, and coolant flow. The machine's control unit processes this data, creates motion commands, and ensures accuracy through feedback signals.</p>

	<h2>4. Key Considerations in CNC Machining</h2>
	<p>a. Material Selection for CNC Machining</p>
	<p>The selection of materials impacts the whole process of machining; its entire lifecycle including prototyping, production, defects, repairs etc. Identifying the material requirements, exploring potential materials, and then choosing the most suitable material are key considerations in ensuring best product outcomes. </p>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 1/figure3.png" alt="Article Image 1" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Bet-Fit CNC materials and their properties </p>
	<p>The selection of the right material for CNC machining projects involves considering several important factors such as: </p>
	<p>1)	Application : Different application require different kinds of material properties. Some application may require high ductility, whereas some may require brittleness, some may require high strength, and some may require greater toughness and so on. Aluminum is used in the aerospace industry as it has high strength-to-weight ratio.</p>
	<p>2)	Operating conditions : Materials may react differently in different operation conditions such as temperature variations, exposure to chemicals, UV radiation, water contact, and flame resistance. Proper understanding of the effect of environment conditions with the materials is required.</p> 
	<p>3)	Dimension / Tolerance : Industries like aerospace require dimensionally stable components with precise tolerances. The materials those are malleable, ductile, properties that make them machine-able are preferred in these industries.</p> 
	<p>4)	Electrical Conductivity : Some applications may require the material to have high conductivity while some process may require them to have insulating properties. For excellent conductivity, materials like copper, silver can be used and for insulating properties, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) may be chosen.</p>
	<p>5)	Physical Appearance : Some customers may prioritize the aesthetics of the finished production as their major requirement. Depending on your customer's desire, maintaining the physical appearance and focusing on secondary finishing operations may also be essential.</p> 
	<p>6)	Cost : Whatever a customer is paying for the product, it should be worthwhile of their time and money. Materials with better properties and failure resistance are expensive. Careful evaluation of the toughness, strength, hardness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance etc. is necessary to determine if a material can serve as a cost-effective alternative.</p>
	<p>7)	Availability : Proper research regarding the availability of the materials is to be done before finalizing the material. A material can have everything your process requires, but if it is not available abundantly, that material has to be replaced with one that is available to you locally or in some easy, indirect ways.</p> 
</p>
	<p>b.	Design Considerations for CNC Machining</p>
	<p>1)	Inner Edges : While dealing with inner edges, a vertical corner radius should be of at least 1/3rd of the cavity depth. Slightly larger corner radius results in higher surface finish quality.</p>
	<p>2)	Thin Walls : If the wall thickness is decreased, it causes the decrement of stiffness of material. This in turn causes vibrations to increase which results in higher errors. Recommended wall thickness values are</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Plastics</td>
      <td>1.5mm</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
	<p>3)	Holes : According to design recommendations, flat-bottom holes should be avoided as much as possible. To make deeper holes, specialized drill bits (minimum diameter of 3 mm) are employed.</p>
	<p>4)	Smaller Features : Similar to the flat-bottom holes, micro-machining (process of creating cavities and holes having diameter of less than 2.5 mm) is recommended to be avoided unless absolutely required.</p>
	<p>5)	e)	Chamfers & Fillets : Chamfer edges are recommended to be at a standard 45° angle unless some other angles are absolutely necessary. For fillets, the radius of interior fillets is recommended to be higher than 1/3rd of the depth of the cavity for preventing tool breakage.</p>
	<p>c.	Quality Control in CNC Machining</p>
	<p>In order to maintain quality by ensuring the production of defect-free products, dimensional accuracy and quality, mitigating risks and costs, and enhancing productivity, quality control is of absolute importance that can be carried out using following processes.</p>
	<p>1)	Customer communication : In a manufacturing business, customers have to be our number one priority. Communicating with them about their needs and demands, keeping them happy with quick contact after receiving a customer inquiry and sending samples is a main requisite in this field.</p>
	<p>2)	Understand the design of the product : After receiving the CAD drawings, engineers responsible for CNC machining should thoroughly evaluate the design, understand the product specifications, and double check all the details before initiating manufacturing process.</p>
	<p>3)	Product and service : The machinist should keep in mind that the main goal is to provide the customers better and unique product with reasonable pricing. From the procurement process to inspection and testing, all procedures play important role in ensuring the top notch quality of the products and services.</p>
	<p>4)	Verification of purchased products : To detect the visible effects, the inspector inspects all purchased products.</p>
	<p>5)	Process inspection : Process inspection can occur at any point along the manufacturing and production cycle. It is done to assure quality and ensure timely delivery of finished orders.</p>
	<p>6)	Final inspection : During the final quality control (QC) inspection, only products that pass the final inspection procedure can be packaged and dispatched to the customers. Documentation of all the inspection and testing findings is done during this process.</p>
	<h2>4.	Choosing a CNC Machining Service for Custom Parts</h2>
	<p>When selecting a CNC machining service, consider:</p>
	<p>1)	Cost and Turnaround Time : The service should fit within the project's budget and timeline.</p>
	<p>2)	Manufacturing Capability : Evaluate the vendor's history, customer reviews, and capabilities.</p>
	<p>3)	Communication : Ask potential vendors about their experience, turnaround times, materials, tools, and additional services.</p>
	
	<h2>4.	Future Trends</h2>
	<p>a)	Use of Plywood in Laser Cutting</p>
	<p>Creation of geometric patterns and etch designs on wood is possible nowadays, all thanks to CNC laser cutting techniques that helps in maintaining the strength, flexibility and durability of milled wood.</p>

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>Injection molding is a crucial manufacturing process in today's world, contributing to the production of a wide range of plastic products across various industries. Injection molding is a process of producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold. Injection molding uses a ram or screw-type plunger to force molten plastic or rubber material into a mold cavity and solidifies into the shape of the mold cavity. This process is widely used due to its high precision for complex shapes. However, there are defects that occur when molten plastic flows out of the mold during injection and solidifies. This defect, known as injection molding flash, degrades the final product's quality and requires additional steps to trim or remove the excess material. Injection molding flash is the thin layer of extruded excess material on the parting line or any other two dissimilar faces where the mold meets and forms a boundary. The removal of injection molding flash is crucial in today's plastic industries to ensure product quality and performance.</p>
	<h2>2.	Understanding Injection Molding Flash</h2>
	<p>Injection molding flash, also known as flashing, is a defect in molding process which occurs when excess material, usually in a thin layer, attaches itself to the product, particularly along the parting line where two surfaces meet. This can also happen in other areas where different shapes of the mold converge. The causes of injection molding can range from incorrect flow rates and high pressures during injection to flaws in mold cavities or the equipment used. The other causes might be material viscosity, pressure, and speed variations.</p>
	<div class="image-container">

          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 1: Flash in injection molding (source :https://go4mould.com/flash-injection-molding)</p>
	<p>Flash has a direct impact on both product quality and production efficiency. Its presence doesn’t only compromise the appearance of the product but also creates functional issues. The excess material in the product surface disrupts the intended design and dimension of the part. It also obstructs moving parts affecting its functionality. An additional process called de-flashing is required to minimize the flash occurrence. This involves cutting, grinding, and breaking to remove the excess material. Additional processes mean additional time and costs of production which leads to slower production rates.</p>

          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 2: Quality comparison due to flashing (source: https://guanxin-machinery.com/injection-molding-flash-trouble-shooting-and-the-remedies/)</p>
	<h2>3.	Causes of Injection Molding Flash</h2>
	<p>Excessive injection pressure:</p>
	<p>Excessive pressure is a significant factor leading to the occurrence of flashing in injection molding process. When the injection speed and pressure are too high, the molten plastic gets pressurized and forces its way between the mold surfaces. This leads to the creation of flash in the form of thin layer of excess material between the mold surfaces</p>
	<p>Inadequate clamping force:</p>	
	<p>Inadequate clamping force is the key cause of the injection molding flash in most cases. When clamping force is not enough, molding halves don’t close completely. This creates gaps that allow the molten plastic to leak during the injection process. This leaked material solidifies at the parting line creating flashes. Also, uneven clamping force is also a major factor in the creation of flashes. Uneven clamping force means pressure imbalances within the mold cavity during the injection process. This imbalance permits the material to flow in the area of low clamping force as plastic tries to escape through the easiest route.</p>
	<p>Mismatched mold halves:</p>
	<p>An injection molding flash occurs when molten material escapes the mold cavity through the parting line. It occurs where the two halves of the injection mold separate to release the plastic part. If they're misaligned and mismatched, the gaps are formed enabling molten material to leak and form flash. </p>
	<p>Wear and tear of the mold:</p>
	<p>Repeated use and continuous operation of the mold over time leads to wear and tear in the mold. This creates misalignment and gaps at the parting line. The molded parts become less precise than the intended design. This kind of wear and tear permits the molten plastic to seep through the gaps during injection creating an undesired flash.</p>

	<h2>4.	Prevention and Remedies for Injection Molding Flash</h2>
	<p>Injection mold flashing is a significant concern in manufacturing process. Effective prevention of injection molding flash is necessary to ensures top product quality, higher production rate and cost savings production. This section will highlight the prevention method and remedies that manufacturers can adapt to avoid injection molding flash.</p>
	<p>Proper maintenance of the mold:</p>
	<p>The mold should be maintained at regular intervals to prevent flash. Proper inspection should be done over time to check if there are unwanted gaps and misalignments due to the wear and tear of the mold. Actions like cleaning and replacement of worn parts should be conducted to minimize the likelihood of flash formation.</p>
	<p>Optimizing injection parameters:</p>
	<p>The injection parameters like injection pressure and clamping force play a vital role in the injection process. Optimizing these parameters based on the specific material properties and part geometry can reduce the likelihood of flash occurrence and achieve uniform distribution of molten plastic. Also, the parameters like injection speed, pack and hold pressure, cooling time, gate design and location should be adequately maintained. </p>
	<p>Ensuring precise mold halves alignment:</p>
	<p>Misaligned mold halves create openings for the molten material to escape through it during the injection process. So, accurate alignment of mold halves is critical for flash prevention. Proper alignment means no openings in the parting line area preventing material leakage. This can be achieved using features like guide pins and bushings in the mold design, these components provide precise points of contact. Also, consistent temperature should be maintained to prevent differential in thermal expansion.</p>
	<p>Regular Quality Checks and Testing:</p>
	<p>Quality checks and testing is essential for the early detection and mitigation of flash-related issues. Regular checks and testing during and after the injection process can quickly identify flashes in products. Visual inspection, measurements, and other testing methods enable manufacturers to detect flash defects promptly and take immediate corrective actions.</p>
	<p>The prevention and remedies for injection molding flash require a multifaceted approach. Along with the above methods, there are other factors to be considered to minimize the occurrence of flash like increasing viscosity of flash, adequate vent system, barrel and nozzle temperature, etc.</p>
	<h2>5.	The Role of Technology in Preventing Injection Molding Flash</h2>
	<p>Advanced molding machines are essential in preventing injection molding flash in today’s world. These machines are equipped with precise control systems and automated features that enhance molding accuracy. They offer improved clamping force control, ensuring proper mold closure and reduced chances of flash occurrence. Additionally, these advanced machines incorporate advanced pressure and temperature sensors that aid in real-time monitoring and adjustment of molding conditions during injection. These advanced molding machines utilize advanced servo-motor technology to provide precise control over clamping force and injection speed.</p>

	<p>Software plays a critical role in flash prevention by enabling precise control over molding parameters. Process monitoring software continuously tracks key variables such as temperature, pressure, and injection speed. Moreover, software-driven simulations and virtual prototyping help in designing molds that minimize flash risks.</p>
	<p>The VHX Series 4K Digital Microscope, by KEYENCE, can measure highly accurate 3D shapes on the submicron order and profiles of defective parts using high-definition images. Even microscopic flashes from melted plastic can be quantitatively measured and inspected, even when they occur due to distortion in the mold or insufficient clamping force. The acquisition of detailed 3D information on the defective part can aid in quickly detecting the cause, allowing for preventive measures.</p>

	<p>An undercut is a feature that may or may not make the ejection of a part from the mold difficult. Power switch slots, teeth of a thread, and locking tabs are prime examples of undercuts that needs to be avoided until and unless the design is indispensable. It is true that special tooling can be used to safely eject the part from the mold even when an undercut is present. But this results in an increment of cost as well as the time frame of the project. </p>

          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 2: Undercut in molded part</p>
	<p>Injection molding undercuts are the features that are not orthogonal to the mold parting line, preventing them from easily or impossible to be ejected from the mold in the direction of the mold opening. However, it also offers some benefits; the presence of undercuts in injection molding lessens or replaces the requirement of secondary processes or assembly. For example, threading into an injection molded part design introduces an undercut feature, simultaneously preventing the need to machine threads in the molded part. Also, undercuts are usually used in mold designs to add assembly features to the injection molded part for better fitting, eliminating the need for other finishing operations. </p>

        <p>Undercuts are a challenging aspect of injection molding that requires careful consideration to balance design, cost, and functionality. By understanding their impacts on mold design and product functionality, manufacturers can make informed decisions to optimize the production process.</p>

	<h2>4.	Types of Undercuts</h2>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 3/Picture3.png" alt="Article Image 1" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 5: Types of Undercuts (source: http://plasticlecturenotes.blogspot.com/2011/09/undercuts.html)</p>
	<p>Undercuts can be of two types: external undercuts and internal undercuts.</p>
	<p>(a) External Undercuts</p>
	<p>These are featured on the outer surface of the molded part identified by grooves, indentations, or protrusions on the external surface of the part. For demolding and easy removal of parts with external undercuts, lateral moving elements like sliders (for simple undercuts), splits, and core pullers (for complex undercuts).</p>
	<p>(b) Internal Undercuts</p>
	<p>These are located on the inside contours of the molded part and are more challenging to deal with when compared to external undercuts since they consist of intricate geometries that cannot be dealt with by lateral movement alone; they need side actions or side pulls. But, even with side actions, the part may remain attached to the core which results in the need for further manual intervention or secondary processes.</p>
	<h2>5.	Undercut Release Mechanisms</h2>
	<p>The dedicated techniques that are used in mold design to aid the smooth and efficient part removal from the mold cavity while still maintaining the integrity of the part and mold of a part with undercuts are called the undercut release mechanism. Some of the common undercut release mechanisms are side actions, lifters, core pullers, mold splits, hydraulic/mechanical actuators, and manual intervention. It is necessary to carefully analyze the geometry and requirement of material properties for that part to successfully select the most appropriate release mechanism. Proper selection as well as implementation of undercut release mechanisms is key to successful as well as cost-effective manufacturing processes that involve undercuts. The selection of the proper undercut release mechanism depends on:</p>
	<p>•	Design Complexity</p>
	<p>•	Type of undercuts</p>
	<p>•	Location of undercut</p>
	<p>•	Production volume</p>
	<p>•	Budget/cost constraints</p>
	<h2>6.	Designing for Undercuts</h2>
	<p>(a)	Challenges of undercutting injection molding</p>
	<p>•	Mold Complexity: Since, undercuts require the addition of slides, lifters, or core pullers; the design complexity is higher in mold design with undercuts.</p>
	<p>•	Draft Requirements: Draft angles should be reduced or kept zero while dealing with undercuts, which increases the challenge to obtain smooth part removal.</p>
	<p>•	Material Selection: Certain materials can stick or deform more during ejection, resulting in part damage, rejection, or increased scrap rates. Also, more issues generate with more rigid materials</p>
	<p>•	Parting Line Challenges: Inappropriate placement of parting lines can lead to poor material flow that leads to molding defects like voids, incomplete filling, sink marks, flash, or difficulty in the assembly of the molded parts.</p>
	<p>•	Increased Cycle Time: Undercuts can be ejected safely; however it requires additional steps like actuating side actions or lifters. This significantly increases the overall cycle time while also reducing production efficiency.</p>
	<p>•	Tooling Costs: As you know, the use of additional components and mechanisms to put up with undercuts means higher costs. They are usually expensive to maintain as well. </p>
	<p>(b)	Strategies for incorporating undercuts in design</p>
	<p>•	Position Parting Lines:</p>
	<p>The parting line is the intersection plane between two molds which helps to solve the undercut problem if they are positioned properly. The reason behind this is: when the feature is divided into two halves by the parting line, the part can be easily ejected from the mold without having the need to include an undercut.</p>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 3/Picture7.png" alt="Article Image 1" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 6: Parting Line Position</p>
	<p>•	Utilize Side-Actions Feature:</p>
	<p>A side-action core is an insert that slides out of the part during the ejection of the part. This feature can be automated to slide in at the same rate as the other parts of the mold and retract when they retract. The molded part is available for extraction only once the side action has been completed which helps in proper extraction. The side action core needs to be perpendicular, and this critical requirement increases the complexity of the mold design.</p>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 3/Picture8.png" alt="Article Image 1" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 7: Using side action core</p>
	<p>•	Use Bump Offs:</p>
	<p>Bump offs are the best choice when dealing with elastic materials like lens covers, phone cases, etc. After the molding process is complete, this insert is removed first and then the main part is ejected normally. However, there are some restrictions while using this mechanism:</p>
	<p>-	The part must be flexible and elastic. </p>
	<p>-	The under feature must not be stiff features like corners and ribs.</p>
	<p>-	The lead angle must be between 300 and 450.</p>
	<p>•	Choose Hand-Loaded Inserts:</p>
	<p>Hand-loaded inserts are different metal pieces that the operator manually places in the mold to prevent any plastic from flowing in. This facilitates the ejection process as the operator is free to remove the piece once the cycle is over and reuse it for the next batch. This is a manual process, which means that it’d naturally take more time to complete. Furthermore, the high temperatures involved create a safety concern as well. Workers use safety gloves and goggles but there is always a chance of burning yourself.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 8: Hand loaded insert</p>
	<p>•	Incorporate Shutoffs:</p>
	<p>If shutoffs are used, they can eliminate the need for side action or hand inserts, reducing the cost and increasing the production rate. These are temporary obstructions that use hooks, clips, etc. in order to snap-fit and prevent the flow in particular regions of the design.</p> 
	<p>•	Lifters:</p>
	<div class="image-container">

          </div>
          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 9: Using lifters</p>
	<h2>7.	Role of software in designing for undercuts</h2>
	<p>(a)	3D Modeling and Visualization: </p>
	<p>3D modeling software helps in creating the CAD model that helps in the visualization of parts to properly understand the complexities and challenges that can be resulted from undercuts. Then, they can plan their design strategies according to that.</p>
	<p>(b)	Draft Analysis:  </p>
	<p>Specialized software tools helps in draft analysis to ensure enough draft angles are created to aid smooth part removal.</p>
	<p>(c)	Mold Flow Analysis: </p>
	<p>With mold flow analysis software, you can identify the flow issues that might occur and then you can alter your design strategies accordingly. </p>
	<p>(d)	Undercut Release Mechanism Simulation: </p>
	<p>With the help of this software, you can assess the effectiveness of different mechanisms and then make the selection of one to ensure safe and effective part ejection. </p>
	<p>(e)	Toolpath Generation: </p>
	<p>This software can create toolpaths for CNC machines that help to achieve precise mold geometry. These are specially used for machining complex mold features to facilitate their smooth part ejection.  </p>
	<h2>8.	Overcoming Undercut Challenges in Injection Molding</h2>
	<p>Collapsible cores and expandable cavities are specialized features that are used in undercut injection molding to ensure the safe ejection of parts. </p>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 3/Picture11.png" alt="Article Image 1" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
	<h2>9.	Innovative solutions for undercut challenges</h2>
	<p>(a)	Multi-Material Molding: </p>
	<p>Successful ejection of parts with undercuts can be attained with the integration of different materials having varied levels of flexibility or shrinkage.</p>
	<p>(b)	Conformal Cooling:  </p>
	<p>Conformal cooling channels can improve the cooling process and check the sticking of parts with undercuts.</p>
	<p>(c)	Micro-Textured Surfaces: </p>
	<p>To minimize friction and adhesion, micro-textured or nano-textured surfaces can be applied to mold components. It helps to ease the release of parts with undercuts. Similarly, these textured surfaces can reduce the requirement for complex release mechanisms.</p>
	<p>(d)	Magnetic Release Mechanism: </p>
	<p>Ejection of the parts with undercuts can be promoted with the application of magnetic release mechanisms into molds. Parts can be released without the need for extensive side actions or lifters, by utilizing controlled magnetic forces.</p>
	<p>(e)	Smart Coatings and Lubricants: </p>
	<p>Using specialized coatings or lubricants, friction can be reduced on mold surfaces to improve the release of parts with undercuts. </p>
	<h2>10.	Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Summing up, despite the challenges that occur due to the presence of undercut in the mold design, proper understanding and management of undercut can lead to several benefits as well. With the proper parting line placement, the use of an appropriate release mechanism, and the use of advanced software, an undercut may prove its worth in the sense that it can be used to increase efficiency, and functionality while focusing on aesthetics. It wouldn't be wrong to say that proper play with the knowledge of undercut might even shape the future landscape of plastic injection molding.</p>

	<h2>1.	Introduction</h2>
	<p>There is always some sort of imperfections on the mold surface due to various factors like injection molding parameters, different physical and chemical properties of the polymer blends, shrinkage, contamination, etc. That’s why most plastic product needs additional treatment to improve the surface finish. When it comes down to the aesthetic appeal of the product, surface finish becomes a critical aspect. Surface finish, also known as surface texture, is the overall texture of the surface determined by the three characteristics of lay, surface roughness, and waviness. Mold texturing is one of the crucial processes in manufacturing industries when producing parts made up of plastic, glass, metal, and ceramic through various molding techniques. The major advantages of mold texture are improved appearance, reduced creases, and enhanced grip. Along with the aesthetics, it also contributes to hiding imperfections like flow lines, sinks, burn scars, etc. Mold texturing also provides functional benefits like strength and enhanced adhesion to the product. The other benefits of mold texturing are improved mold release, branding, and the creation of parts that mimic natural materials like wood, rock, leather, etc. Trade associations like the Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) and the Society of German Engineers/ Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) determine the standards and designation for the molding finish and textures. Mold-Tech (MT) and Yick Sang (YS) are the two companies that have developed their own standards</p>
	<h2>2.	Understanding Mold Textures</h2>
	<p>Mold texturing is the process of creating various patterns, textures or designs on the product's surface. The purpose of mold texturing is to impart a distinct appearance to the final product during the molding process. The appearance can range from simple patterns like grains or dots to complex designs that mimic natural materials, such as wood, leather, or stone. Mold texturing plays a significant role in enhancing the visual appeal, functionality, and differentiation of molded products. Generally, Mold surface texturing is done by five common methods and they are: </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>(a) Sanding and Polishing</p>
	<p>Machining operation always leaves behind some tool marks on the workpiece. So, these tool marks should be removed before transferring the workpiece to injection molding. Sanding and polishing are done to remove those marks and other surface imperfections by the technicians using rotary tools, sandpapers, and other abrasive papers. The factor to consider while sanding and polishing is not to exceed dimensional tolerances.</p>

          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 1: Sanding and Polishing (source : https://www.mirka.com/ , https://sandpaperamerica.com/) </p>
	<p>(b)	EDM Spark erosion</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>It uses graphite or copper electrode immersed in an electrolytic bath of water or oil. When the electrode receives its threshold current, it sparks against the tool wall. This process melts the targeted body and is immediately quenched by the surrounding electrolyte. Thermal shock is generated which causes the metal to fragment into tiny particles and they are flushed away. It is applicable for hard and soft metals which required very tight tolerances.</p>

          <p class="figure-caption">Fig 2: EDM(source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oPmFb4liVM&ab_channel=EDMPrecision)</p>
	<p>(c)	Media Blasting</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>High-pressure air sprays are used to transfer abrasive media (e.g., sand, beads) on molds, achieving a uniform matte or satin finish. It is controlled by skilled operators. This process is very fast, cost-effective, and minimal waste. It Allows distinct textures without overlap.</p>

	<p>(d)	Chemical photoetching</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Photoetching applies patterns to mold tools by coating them with light-sensitive photoresist and then projecting desired patterns with UV light followed by etching in acid baths and creating textures. The process is fast, cost-effective, and fine details, but limited by undercuts and curved surfaces.</p>
	<p>(e)	Laser etching </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Laser etching is the process that allows mapping textures onto curved surfaces using 3D computer modeling for precise alignment and 5-axis motion control for accurate tracking, even in undercuts. This method is very common in automobiles for consistent long-length patterns despite its higher costs and longer setup time.</p>

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past few decades, the injection molding process has evolved significantly more than almost any other manufacturing process and has influenced the development of numerous products. Injection molding consists of softening the material in a heated cylinder, injecting it into the mold cavity under pressure, and then hardening it by cooling. Injection molding technologies are mainly divided into two main categories: hot runner and cold runner mold systems. A hot runner mold is a system that heats the molds and runner channels to keep material in a molten state for the duration of the injection process until the mold cavity is filled, leaving no plastic inside the runners. In a cold runner system, the runners and the molds are not heated. The plastic fills the runners and mold cavities. The material then cools inside these cavities, which keeps the runners and parts connected until they are ejected and separated. Each of these systems has distinct advantages over the other. So, the choice between these two mold systems depends upon various factors like cost-effectiveness, material usage, material wastage, cycle times, and part quality.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Understanding Cold Runner Molds</h2>
          <p>
            Cold runner molds are the common type of injection molds that are being used for decades. It consists of two or three plates held within the base plate. In cold runner molds, molten plastic is conveyed into the mold cavity through unheated channels, known as runners. The runner is basically a delivery system that distributes the plastics to each cavity within the mold. The cold runner mold system is divided into two types: (i) two-plate system and (ii) three-plate system. The two-plate cold runner system consists of two plates with the stationary mold containing the sprue, runners, gate, and cavities. The runner is attached to the final product and should be cut off. In three-plate system, there is no need to cut the runner from the injection molded part, and the mold has a self-ejection system for part removal.

            The working principle involves injecting molten plastic into the mold cavity through an unheated channel. First, the plastic is melted and then injected into the mold via a sprue connected to the runners. These runners guide the molten plastic to the mold cavities, ensuring uniform distribution of the material through gates. Then, the final part is formed, after the plastic cools and solidifies. In two-plate mold system, the runners and the part are not separated, requiring an ejection system to detach the molded component from the core half of the mold. In contrast, three-plate molds have a separate cavity plate that contains the runners. In three-plate system, there is no need for the separation of runners and the part, and doesn’t require an ejection system.

          <h3>Advantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower initial cost:</strong> The absence of a heated manifold system in cold runner molds makes it lower in initial cost compared to a hot runner system. Cold runner molds have a simpler design which makes it a budget-friendly option. Also, maintenance and repair costs are very low compared to the hot runner molds.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility in material use:</strong> As the runners are unheated, there is no risk of heat degradation or pre-mature melting for heat-sensitive plastics. Whether it's commodity plastics like polyethylene, or engineering plastics like ABS or nylon, cold runner molds are feasible for these all materials in manufacturing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Material waste:</strong> In each molding cycle, the unheated runners that are filled with molten plastic solidify along with the molded parts. When the part has to be ejected after each cycle, the solidified plastic at runners becomes unusable. This creates a major drawback when manufacturing on large scales. This results in a huge amount of material waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Longer cycle times:</strong> Cold runner mold has longer cycle times compared to hot runner mold. In unheated runners, the cooling and solidification phase of the plastic takes a considerable amount of time, which slows down the overall manufacturing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Understanding Hot Runner Molds</h2>
          <p>
            Nowadays, hot runner molds are the cutting-edge technology for injection molding. It consists of two plates that are heated through a manifold system. This manifold ensures that the plastic remains in a molten state until it flows into the cavity of the mold. Hot runner molds are categorized into two types, and they are insulated hot runners and heated hot runners. Insulated hot runner molds have extremely thick runners in the mold plate, which causes part of the molten plastic to cool down and insulate the system. This insulation results in reduced heat loss and allows the mold system to maintain an open plastic flow. Heated hot runner is further divided into two types: externally heated and internally heated molds. In externally heated molds, rods, coils, or pipes are used to heat the plates from outside of the mold. This type of mold is suitable for materials that are sensitive to thermal variations like polymers. On the other hand, internally heated mold has a heating component inside of the mold which leads to a drop in injection pressure. Also, it offers better flow due to the heated runner and gate tip control.

          <h3>Advantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No material waste:</strong> Hot runner mold eliminates the need for the runners in their molding process and this results in the complete elimination of wastage due to solidified runners.</li>
            <li><strong>Faster cycle times:</strong> They offer faster cycle times than cold runner molds. The molten plastic is continuously supplied to the mold cavities, allowing for quicker filling and cooling which saves lots of time. This advantage makes them a suitable choice for high-volume production businesses.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher initial cost:</strong> One of the major drawbacks of the hot runner mold system is their higher initial cost as it requires manifold, heating components, and nozzles, to maintain the plastic in a molten state throughout the process. The additional components and technology involved in hot runner systems contribute to increased upfront investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited in material use:</strong> Some plastics are sensitive to high temperatures, and longer exposure to heat in hot runner molds can lead to material degradation or undesirable changes in the plastic properties. Heat-sensitive polymers like thermally unstable resins might not be suitable for use in hot runner molds.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Comparison between Cold Runner Molds and Hot Runner Molds</h2>
<p><strong>Cost effectiveness</strong></p>
          <p>
            Hot runner systems require a higher initial investment and maintenance cost due to their complexity, including manifold systems, heating components, and nozzles. The reduced cycle time enhances efficiency and output rates, offsetting the initial investment over time. In contrast, cold runner mold systems have a lower tooling cost which makes them more economical for small-scale production and prototyping. The absence of a manifold system simplifies the design and lowers expenses. That’s why the cold runner system gets a cutting edge over the hot runner system on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, cold runner molds result in significant material wastage due to solidified plastics at runners and gates, making them less cost-effective for long-term and large-scale production.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Production speed</strong></p>
          <p>
            Hot runner molds system is faster in production speed compared to cold runner molds. The streamlined design of hot runner mold systems eliminates the runner removal process which enables faster filling and cooling of parts. On the other hand, cold runner molds consist of additional steps of separating, grinding, and recycling runners which leads to slower production. While hot runner systems may require a higher initial investment, their ability to produce more parts per unit of time makes them a preferred choice for manufacturers seeking increased production efficiency and output rates.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Materials use</strong></p>
          <p>
            Cold runner molds are superior to hot runner molds in terms of material varieties that can be used in the molding process. Some thermoplastic materials like thermal-sensitive resin or polymers are particularly sensitive to temperature variation. The heat in a hot mold system creates negative impacts on the mechanical properties of these materials. Cold runners don’t have any heating component which makes them more compatible with a wide range of thermoplastic materials.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Quality of final product</strong></p>
          <p>
            Hot runner molds offer superior final product quality than cold runner molds. The hot runner system delivers an excellent filling profile with consistent injection pressure to manufacture well-formed and defect-free parts. In contrast, cold runner molds have to go through injection pressure drop due to heat transfer to the mold plates during plastic flow. This leads to shrinkage and the formation of sink marks and under-filled parts.

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Overmolding is a manufacturing process in which two different materials are bonded together with the help of an injection molding process that provides excellent adhesion between them. This process uses insert molding or a two-shot process in order to combine stiff plastic base components usually with the outer layer of malleable thermoplastic elastomers. Being an elastomer material, it bears the property to absorb the shock, dampen the vibration, and seals the vacant parts. The over-molding method is widely utilized in sectors like consumer goods, automotive, and electrical components, and medical and health-related industries. Out of numerous examples of over-molding, one such use for comfort and grip is described in further sections.

          <p>
            In the traditional injection molding manufacturing process, for generating a solid product, the molten materials are sent to the mold cavity whereas in the over-molding injection molding process, the material is added to an already-existing object or structure known as the substrate made of metal, plastic or glass. The technique utilizes a variety of materials for the over-mold and you can also include the over-mold with additional components, such as coloring agents and foaming agents, to get the desired outcome for the completed product. There are mainly two types of over-molding processes called insert molding and two-shot over-molding.

          <h3>2.1 Insert Molding</h3>
          <p>
            Insert molding is used to combine metal and plastics (non-plastic parts are called inserts), or multiple combinations of materials and components into a single unit. The inserted component is mostly a thread or rod and in some rare and complex cases, they can be a battery or motor. The process results in improved wear resistance, tensile strength, study, long-lasting, and weight reduction which is why numerous sectors are utilizing insert molding techniques.

          <h3>2.2 Two-shot Over-molding</h3>
          <p>
            In the two-shot plastic molding process, two separate plastic resins are molded together in a single machining cycle. The two-shot molding technique is divided into two steps where the first involves an injection of resin into a mold, which is then cooled to create a solid object, much like conventional injection molding. The newly-molded object is exported to a second mold in the second stage using a rotating platen or a robotic arm. Depending on the design, the newly-formed part is then given a second injection of resin in or around certain areas of the first mold. Following the formation of a molecular link between the two plastic resins, the multi-resin molded object is cooled and expelled.

          <h2>3. Materials Used in Overmold Manufacturing</h2>
          <p>
            ABS, Acetal, HDPE, LCP, PEI, PMMA, Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, PPA, PPS, PS, PSU, TPE, TPU, PEEK, Liquid Silicone Rubber, etc. are some materials used in over-molding. Some are described below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE):</strong> HDPE is a widely used polymer in the market as it is advantageous for large components like corrosion-resistant pipework, plastic lumber, and many other components that require special physical performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS):</strong> ABS is a material preferred for over-molding operations in applications like electronics or automobile parts. ABS provides several advantages like low melting point, highly recyclable, easily moldable, low heat and electricity conductivity, etc. at a very cheap cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymethyl Methacrylate Acrylic (PMMA):</strong> PMMA is a cost-effective polymer preferred in applications like optical, light, and weather ability properties due to its benefits like resistance to UV radiation, high refractive index, chemical resistance, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE):</strong> It has shorter mold cycles that help in the two-shot injection molding process by making it easier and less expensive. Although TPE can lose elastic properties at higher temperatures, it is the most suitable plastic for impact resistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU):</strong> TPU is highly popular as it has the ability to handle high temperatures and also it is chemical, oil, and abrasion resistant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Factors Influencing Material Selection in the Over-molding Process</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tensile Strength:</strong> Tensile strength is the resistance to being pulled apart which determines the material's ability to withstand forces without breaking or losing the elasticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Izod Impact (Notched) or Toughness:</strong> This helps in measuring the impact resistance of the materials by determining the energy required to break a notched sample.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexural Modulus:</strong> It measures the material's flexibility and behavior under bending and loading-unloading conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dielectric Strength:</strong> Important for electrical applications, this property helps in determining how resistive in nature the material is.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical Resistance:</strong> It is required for a material to resist damage when it is exposed to specific chemicals.</li>

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            By injecting molten material into a mold, the industrial method of injection molding enables the fabrication of parts in huge quantities. The substance, which is often a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer, is heated, mixed, and then pressed into a mold cavity, where it cools and solidifies into the mold's form. The success of injection molding depends on selecting the proper type of mold since it influences the product's quality, cost, and manufacturing efficiency. Molds may be divided into many sorts according to the quantity and nature of the cavities they hold. Multi-cavity molds and family molds are two prevalent forms of mold.
          </p>

          <p>
            A single injection molding cycle can produce many pieces of the same type using multi-cavity molds. Those molds have multiple identical cavities. For example, to make several bottle caps simultaneously, a multi-cavity mold can be used. Multi-cavity molds include several benefits such as shorter cycle time, cheaper cost per part, and greater design parts. Family molds contain a variety of cavities which allow the manufacturing of several related items of different types. This can be achieved in a single injection molding cycle. For instance, using family molds body and four wheels of toy automobiles can be created simultaneously. With family mold lower tooling cost and production effectiveness can be achieved.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Understanding Multi-Cavity Injection Molds</h2>
          <p>
            Injection molds with several identical cavities, or multi-cavity injection molds, enable manufacturing numerous pieces of the same type within a single injection molding cycle. A multi-cavity mold, for instance, may make four bottle caps at once. Multi-cavity injection molds operate similarly to single-cavity molds, with the exception that a runner system uniformly distributes the molten material throughout the many cavities. According to the material and mold design, the runner system, which comprises passages connecting the injection nozzle to the cavities, can be either cold or hot.
          </p>

          <div class="image-container">

          <p>
            Multi-cavity injection molds have a higher production rate as they can manufacture more components each cycle than single-cavity molds. In terms of large-scale manufacturing, this method is cost-effective because of lower cost per item, energy use, labor cost, and machine wear. As this method can provide consistent cooling, filling, and pressure across cavities, the uniformity and quality of the parts can be enhanced. Multi-cavity injection molds do, however, have significant drawbacks that must be taken into account. They need more intricate mold design, production, and maintenance than single-cavity molds, which results in several drawbacks, one of which is that they have a high initial cost. Due to its ability to only generate components of the same size, shape, and material, multi-cavity injection molds also have restricted design freedom. Injection molds with several cavities can also provide certain technical difficulties, such as balancing the runner system, managing mold temperature, and avoiding parting line and flash problems.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Understanding Family Injection Molds</h2>
          <p>
            Family injection molds are molds utilized in the process of injection molding to produce parts or components at the same time. Designers create these molds to accommodate cavities or impressions within a mold allowing for the production of different elements, in a single molding cycle. The use of family injection molds brings both advantages and disadvantages, which depend on the production requirements and complexity of part designs.
          </p>

          <p>
            One notable advantage of family injection molds is their ability to produce parts simultaneously offering flexibility, in manufacturing. This not only helps reduce tooling costs but also enhances production efficiency while facilitating modifications to individual components. Family injection molds are particularly well suited for low-volume production scenarios involving varied parts that demand variations or components for a specific assembly. One drawback of using family injection molds is the potential for imbalances in filling, pressure, and cooling among the cavities. These imbalances can have an impact on the quality and consistency of the parts resulting in defects, like warping, shrinkage, flash, or short shots. It's important to note that family injection molds are best suited for parts that can be molded under conditions, including material type, temperature requirements, cycle time, and clamping force.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Comparison between Multi-cavity Injection Molds and Family Injection Molds</h2>
          <p>Based on production requirements and needs, family injection and cavity injection molds have discrete benefits and drawbacks. In this section, two molds types will be compared in terms of production rate, cost efficiency, adaptability, and quality assurance.</p>

          <h3>1. Production rate</h3>
          <p>
            Due to their ability to create more pieces each cycle than family injection molds, multi-cavity injection molds have a greater production rate. As a result, the injection molding process becomes more productive and efficient while cutting down on cycle time. For instance, whereas a family mold may simultaneously make one bottle cap and one bottle body, a multi-cavity mold can produce four bottle caps at once. In terms of production rate, the family injection mold can create fewer components in each cycle compared to multi-cavity molds. Family injection molds offer versatility in making several pieces simultaneously, resulting in less material use in optimum time. For low-volume manufacture of intricate and varied parts with the need for a variety of modifications, family injection molds are considered suitable.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Cost-effectiveness</h3>
          <p>
            In large-scale manufacturing, multi-cavity injection molds are more cost-effective than family injection molds because they may reduce the cost per item by cutting back on material waste, energy use, labor costs, and machine wear. However, since they require more intricate mold design, manufacturing, and maintenance than family injection molds, multi-cavity injection molds have a greater starting cost than family injection molds. In small-scale manufacturing, family injection molds are more cost-effective than multi-cavity injection molds because they may cut tooling costs by including numerous pieces into a single mold. Family injection molds, however, cost more per component than multi-cavity injection molds because they prolong cycle times and result in more material waste, energy use, labor costs, and machine wear.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Flexibility</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of part design and variation, multi-cavity injection molds are less flexible than family injection molds. The only pieces that multi-cavity injection molds can create are identically sized, shaped, and made of materials. This restricts the use of multi-cavity injection molds for the production of novel items or the customization of already existing products. Furthermore, once created, multi-cavity injection molds are challenging to replace or adjust since any change might compromise the mold's performance and balance. In terms of part design and variation, family injection molds are more flexible than multi-cavity injection molds. Family injection molds may create components in a variety of sizes, shapes, and materials. This enables the use of family injection molds to produce new items or modify ones that already exist. Family injection molds may also be changed or modified more easily once they are created since each cavity can be switched out or replaced without impacting the others.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Quality control</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of component consistency and homogeneity, multi-cavity injection molds have greater quality control than family injection molds. Injection molds with many cavities may maintain consistent component quality and dimensions by ensuring that each cavity receives the same amount of cooling, filling, and pressure. By maximizing the mold design and process parameters, multi-cavity injection molds can reduce part defects and imperfections. Family injection molds have less control over quality and consistency than multi-cavity injection molds. Variations in the size, shape, and material of the cavities may affect the final components' quality and uniformity. To guarantee high-quality components, family injection molds must be carefully designed and managed to address issues such as imbalances in filling, cooling, and pressure.
          </p>
	<h2>5. Comparison Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The table below sums up the key differences between multi-cavity and family molds.

<h2>6. How to Choose Between Multi-cavity Injection Molds and Family Injection Molds</h2>
          
          <h3>a. Assessing Production Needs</h3>
          <p>
            Assessing your manufacturing requirements, including the quantity, speed, and complexity of your products, is the first stage. Multi-cavity injection molds are a good choice if you need to make a lot of basic, homogenous parts with few changes at a greater production rate, reduced cost per part, and consistent component quality. Family injection molds are a good choice if you need to create small quantities of intricate and varied parts that need several variants or components for a certain assembly since they may save tooling costs, increase production efficiency, and make part changes easier.
          </p>

          <h3>b. Considering Design Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            Consider the form, size, material, and look of your pieces, as well as their design complexity, in the second phase. You could use multi-cavity injection molds if all of your components are the same size, shape, material, and look since they can provide easy mold design, manufacturing, and maintenance. Family injection molds are a good choice if your components differ in terms of their sizes, weights, compositions, or aesthetics since they permit part design and variation flexibility.
          </p>

          <h3>c. Evaluating Cost Factors</h3>
          <p>
            For the third phase, an evaluation of the project’s cost variable is needed, this includes the original investment, ongoing cost, and return on investment. For large-scale manufacturing with high production volume, multi-cavity injection molds can be cost-effective. Similarly, for small-scale manufacturing with modest production volume family injection molds can be cost-effective. This can be achieved by lower tooling costs.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In this article, two types of injection molds that are commonly used in industry: multi-cavity injection molds and family injection molds are explored. Working principles, advantages and disadvantages, cost-effectiveness, and applications of those molds for injection molding have been compared and contrasted. A few case studies on the production usage of these mold types in the industry are also included. Additionally, some recommendations for selecting one of those injection molding for injection molding is provided. Choosing the right type of mold is considered important because it affects the quality, cost, and efficiency of the product. If the wrong type of mold is chosen, it can end up with defective parts, wasted material, increased expense, and reduced productivity. Therefore, it’s important to evaluate the production needs, design complexity, and cost factors before molds. By choosing the right type of mold, the injection molding process can be optimized and can achieve the best outcomes and return on investment.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          A cleanroom is a controlled environment maintained to filter out pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, and aerosol particles and make the surroundings clean. In this process, the outside air goes through special filters called High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) or Ultra Low Particulate Air (ULPA) filters to make the air decontaminated and then enter the controlled environment. The room has positive pressure that causes a specific pattern of airflow to push out any dirt/ impurities that are present inside the room. The contaminated air is either returned to the ambient or sent back through the filters and the process repeats again in a loop. Companies that make things easily affected by air dirtiness really value cleanrooms because they keep the things they make safe and good quality.

        <h2>2. Understanding Cleanroom Specifications</h2>
        <p>
          Cleanrooms are classified according to the level of cleanliness (particle count of the air) and are checked at timely intervals to make certain they are able to maintain their classification.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Determine your cleanroom size and the number of areas that need to have their particles measured.</li>
          <li>Determine what level of cleanliness you need for your desired classification.</li>
          <li>Measure the required areas.</li>
          <li>Take the averages of the number and size of particles in each location for the cleanroom.</li>
          <li>Use a particle counter that will automatically find the Upper Confidence Limit to determine the type of classification you fall under.</li>

        <p>
          U.S. General Administration’s standards (FS209E) were used worldwide before the introduction of cleanroom classifications and standards by the International Standards Organization (ISO). FS209E is forecasted to be completely replaced by ISO standards in the next 5 years. FS209E consists of six classes where Class 1 is considered as the cleanest and Class 100,000 as the dirtiest.
        </p>

        <p>
          ISO classification system adds two cleaner standards and one dirtier standard with the cleanest cleanroom as class 1 and the dirtiest as class 9. ISO class 3 is nearly equal to FS209E class 1, while ISO class 8 nearly equals FS209E class 100,000.

        <h3>2.1 Key Elements of Cleanroom Specifications</h3>
	<div class="image-container">
          <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 8/Picture4.png" alt="Cleanroom" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
	<p class="figure-caption">Fig 4: Key elements of cleanroom design (Source: <a href="https://www.airwoods.com/news/key-elements-of-cleanroom-design/">https://www.airwoods.com/news/key-elements-of-cleanroom-design/</a>)</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Airflow Rates and Direction:</strong> Specific airflow rates and directions are maintained in the cleanroom to ensure a uniform distribution of filtered air and discard the formation of stagnant air pockets where particles could mount up. More air is needed for bigger rooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressurization:</strong> With the help of 2 common pressurization methods, cleanrooms are pressurized to create controlled air movement to prevent contamination of dirt/dust.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Positive Pressure:</strong> By keeping the cleanroom at a higher pressure than its adjacent areas, the entering of unfiltered air from the outside air can be prevented.</li>
              <li><strong>Negative Pressure:</strong> By keeping the cleanroom at a lower pressure than the surrounding area, escaping contaminants from the cleanroom to other parts of the facility can be prevented.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Temperature and Humidity Control:</strong> In order to prevent the introduction of moisture, and contaminants in the environment and protect sensitive equipment from damage due to unsuitable temperature and humidity levels, cleanrooms focus on control over temperature and humidity levels. This makes the working environment conducive to consistent manufacturing processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Particulate Count:</strong> As mentioned before, cleanrooms are classified based on ISO standards that depend on the maximum allowable particle count /m³. Particulate count sets benchmarks for the maximum level of contamination that can be present for the planned processes or industries. Also, the materials used in cleanrooms play a vital role in establishing cleanliness levels by minimizing the level of contaminants caused by internal generation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Designing to Cleanroom Specifications</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Material Selection for Cleanrooms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> If you have an expansion of the cleanroom in mind, modular cleanroom setups with moveable wall panels offer better adaptability.</li>
          <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Different materials cater to different ISO cleanroom classifications.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>SoftWall:</strong> Creates ISO Class 7-8 cleanrooms</li>
              <li><strong>RigidWall:</strong> Creates ISO Class 5-6 cleanrooms</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cleaning Agents:</strong> HardWall cleanroom wall materials necessitate coatings that are powerful cleaning agents. However, RigidWall materials like acrylic, PVC, and polycarbonate are apt for less aggressive cleaning agents and processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Aluminum structures are lightweight and they are mostly scratch-resistant. Lighter materials (vinyl modular panels, epoxy-coated drywall) can be easily scratched which generates particles that can interfere with processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Obviously, the final decision is based on budget; it includes particulate control while investing in airflow, filtration systems, and energy efficiency. The finishing should be affordable with optimum features. Some commonly used materials in the cleanroom are:
            <ul>
              <li>Aluminum, steel, and epoxy-coated stainless steel are used for modular wall and ceiling panels</li>
              <li>Epoxy-coated, resin flooring, vinyl composition tile (VCT) for flooring</li>
              <li>Tempered glass or polycarbonate for windows and glazing</li>
              <li>Silicone or EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) for gaskets</li>
              <li>Air diffusers, HEPA/ULPA filters, ductwork, and dampers are made from materials that prevent particle shedding</li>
              <li>Stainless steel or impact-resistant plastics for wall and corner guards</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Layout and Design Considerations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Determine Project Budget:</strong> Considering the size, type, classification standards, and design complexity, determine the budget beforehand to avoid unplanned expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider a Modular Cleanroom for Greater Design Flexibility:</strong> Modular cleanrooms constructed from pre-fabricated components offer faster installation as well as versatility in the sense of future modifications, expansions, or reconfigurations.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose the Right ISO Classification for Your Application:</strong> With the help of information about the particle size and cost-benefit analysis, select the apt ISO classification and optimize the design.</li>
          <li><strong>Understand Your Process Flow:</strong> You need to define operational protocols to guide personnel as well as product movement by planning space allocation and designing optimal work surface layout to have efficient entry and exit.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget-Aligned Material Selection:</strong> You need to select materials on the basis of non-particle shedding characteristics, chemical compatibility, and ESD protection while considering the budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Optimize HVAC System Design:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not place chairs, equipment, or furniture in areas that are conduit to vents.</li>
              <li>Use chairs that allow airflow through.</li>
              <li>Use shelves with perforations or bars</li>
              <li>Do not stack the equipment too closely together</li>
              <li>Use modular furniture as they are easy to move</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
<h2>3.3 HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) System Design for Cleanrooms</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Airflow Control:</strong> HVAC systems ensure proper airflow control throughout the cleanroom. Also, they maintain positive and negative pressures as required.</li>
          <li><strong>Air Filtration:</strong> High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and ultra-low penetration air (ULPA) filters remove particles to meet the cleanliness requirements of the cleanroom.</li>
          <li><strong>Temperature and Humidity Control:</strong> HVAC systems have heating, cooling components, humidifiers, and dehumidifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Backup Systems:</strong> HVAC systems consist of backup systems that can automatically activate in case of primary system malfunctions to ensure smooth process flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> HVAC design should be energy-efficient by having variable speed drives, heat recovery systems, and optimized airflow designs that add to energy savings.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance with ISO Standards:</strong> HVAC system designs need to be aligned with the ISO classification of the cleanroom.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring and Control Systems:</strong> HVAC systems consist of real-time monitoring and control of temperature, humidity, pressure differentials, and airflow rates.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Maintaining Cleanroom Specifications</h2>
        <h3>A. Regular Monitoring and Testing:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use particle counters, environmental sensors, and monitoring systems for regular monitoring of particle counts, temperature, humidity, and pressure differentials.</li>
          <li>Perform routine air quality tests to ensure and maintain the cleanliness levels in compliance with ISO classifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Cleaning and Maintenance Procedures:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use deionized water to scrub all surfaces, floors, walls, and benches.</li>
          <li>Multi-bucket mopping systems with non-marring wheels, seamless buckets, and dirty water control can be used.</li>
          <li>Floors should be damp mopped daily before normal work shifts with distilled water and vacuumed dry.</li>
          <li>Mop the floors weekly with detergent and a HEPA filter vacuum.</li>
          <li>Vacuum walls and ceilings should be used daily to remove deposits.</li>
          <li>Clean walls with a sponge and distilled water.</li>
          <li>Move slowly in the cleanroom to prevent air turbulence.</li>
          <li>All tools should be cleaned before entering with a 70% IPA solution.</li>
          <li>HEPA-filtered air should not be allowed to reach your body.</li>
          <li>During break time, all products, supplies, and materials should be covered.</li>
        </ol>

          <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Plastic injection molding is the most commonly used process in manufacturing. In this process, molten plastic is injected into a heated mold. After cooling and solidification, the plastic material takes the shape of the mold and the finished part is then ejected. Depending on the particular requirements of the product, it may undertake further procedures like trimming, assembly, painting, etc. Different plastic products and components for automotive, electrical components, consumer goods, medical equipment, aerospace parts, etc. can be produced with this process. Different types of plastic materials are used in plastic injection molding based on their material properties. One of the commonly used materials for plastic injection molding is Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO).
            Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO) is a crystalline thermoplastic. It is widely used for plastic injection molding due to its properties like high-temperature resistance, excellent electrical insulation, resistance to different chemicals, dimensional stability, flame retardancy, versatile application, easy and smooth processing, etc.

          <h2>II. PPO Plastic</h2>
          <h3>a. Chemical composition and structure</h3>
          <p>
            Structurally, PPO comprises phenylene rings linked together by ether linkages in the 1,4 or para-positions, with methyl groups attached to carbon atoms in the 2 and 6 positions. It is produced by oxidative coupling of phenylene oxide monomer using oxygen and copper-based catalysts. It is resistant to high temperatures with a very high glass transition temperature of 210°C. However, due to the difficulty in processing, and poor organic solvent resistance, it is rarely used in its pure form. Therefore, it is commonly used in combination with polystyrene, high-impact styrene-butadiene copolymer, or polyamide to improve melt processability.

          </ul>
          <h2>IV. The Injection Molding Process with PPO</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Material preparation:</strong> PPO must be appropriately dried to eliminate moisture before using PPO resin in injection molding.  A baking oven can be utilized for 3 hours dry to PPO plastics, and by heating PPO plastic to 750C- 950C.</li>
            <li><strong>Heating and Melting:</strong> All the barrels in the system are carried heat treated to respective corresponding temperature ranges of 2000C to 2600C. The hot flow path adapted to the injection system is heated to 2300C to 2600C. Likewise, the cover half in the injection mold is heated to 650C – 750C, whereas, the dynamic model is heated to 450C – 550C   The PPO resin is then loaded into the hopper, where it is subjected to controlled heating with a heated barrel. The resin is converted into molten condition within the temperature range of 2300C to 2700C. </li>
            <li><strong>Injection:</strong> When the molten PPO resin reaches the desirable temperature, it is pushed forward to the injection nozzle located at the end of the barrel. The injection pressure is 100kg/cm2- 120kg/cm2, therefore the molten PPO resin is under high pressure. Then the high-pressure molten PPO is injected into the mold cavity through the nozzle. When PPO fills the cavity, it takes the shape of the part to be produced.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> The mold is equipped with a cooling apparatus that cools and solidifies the PPO material. The timing of cooling forming is 38s.</li>
            <li><strong>Ejection:</strong> After cooling and solidification, the mold is opened and the part is ejected with the 
help of the ejection mechanism.
</li>
          </ol>

Similarly, the study suggested replacing aluminum with mPPO and optimizing the injection molding process. It not only reduced the weight but also the material costs. Moreover, optimization of the injection molding process, on the other hand, improves productivity by reducing cycle times.</p>
          <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Material development is crucial to achieving light-weighting goals in the automotive industry. Proper material testing and evaluation should be emphasized to assess the performance requirements of newly developed materials.</p>

          <h2>VIII. Future Trends in PPO Plastic Injection Molding</h2>
          <p>Future innovations in PPO materials and molding techniques are more likely to concentrate on environmental sustainability and eco-friendliness. The development of bio-based PPO blends with both improved properties and good recyclability can be considered. Similarly, the reduction of PPO waste production and energy consumption can be achieved with the implementation of a closed-loop recycling system. On the other hand, the application of advanced molding techniques like micro-molding, multi-material molding, and 3D printing to produce different complex PPO components is expected. Additionally, the forecast done by Research and Markets states that the polyphenylene oxide (PPO) market was valued at US$1,298.26 million in 2017 and is expected to reach US$1,879.84 million by 2026 with a growth rate of 4.3% during the forecast period. This indicates a significant increase in the value of the market.</p>

          <h2>IX. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>To conclude, PPO offers several exceptional qualities like high-temperature resistance, high dielectric strength, chemical resistance, flame retardancy, and dimensional stability. These properties enhance the versatility of PPO, diversifying its application in different industries. Likewise, several problems associated with pure PPO use have been addressed with the development of modified PPO. Moreover, further innovations have been emphasized in PPO materials and molding techniques to improve performance and sustainability. Therefore, PPO injection molding can be a viable choice for the next plastic design and manufacture-related project.</p>

          <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
          <p>Polyamide (PA) and glass fiber (GF) are two materials that have revolutionized injection molding industries with their remarkable properties. Polyamide is a class of thermoplastics with high mechanical strength, chemical resistance, wear resistance, and high melting point. This is why polyamides are an ideal choice for applications demanding toughness and temperature resistance. They are also commonly known as nylon. Glass fibers are the most common of all reinforcing fibers for polymer matrix composites. It is used in composites and plastics to enhance their mechanical attributes due to its high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness. These two materials are combined into a single blend known as PA+GF to create products with a unique set of properties.

          <h2>II. The Composition of PA+GF</h2>
          <p>PA+GF, often referred to as Glass-filled nylon or glass-filled polyamide, is a composite material derived from nylon (a synthetic polyamide thermoplastic). Within this composite, short glass fibers are intimately dispersed within a nylon matrix. This blending of nylon with glass fibers creates a distinctive material composition with remarkable properties. There are various grades available today, and most of them are either based on Polyamide 6 or 66.</p>

          <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Efficient and cost-effective methods of manufacturing have always been a challenge for product developers. The two well-known manufacturing techniques that are most favored are prototype tooling and injection molding. Each of these approaches carries unique strengths and limitations. This article delves into the deep comparison between these two methods based on cost, time efficiency, material selection, complexity, design freedom, as well as quality to understand their differences thoroughly.
          </p>
          <h2>II. What is Prototype Tooling?</h2>
          <p>
            Prototype tooling (also called rapid tooling) is an approach to manufacturing that allows making tools rapidly as well as cost-effectively in a short period of time. The tooling uses low-cost injection molds to make small batches of products. It is a type of injection mold tooling that is created rapidly at a cost-effective rate so that the complete analysis of the function, validation, and evaluation of your design can be done thoroughly before any mass production. Rapid prototyping tools speed up and make it less expensive to create new products.

            Soft tooling is a cost-effective option ranging from low to medium-volume production whose flexibility allows for rapid design iterations, accommodates various materials, suits complex geometries, and also offers a smooth finish. It has limited material compatibility and longer cycle times. It lacks durability and wears out quickly. It is further divided into:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct soft tooling</li>
            <li>Indirect soft tooling</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Creating multiple molds in this method may result in some dimensional errors.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>IV. What is Injection Molding?</h2>
          <p>
            Injection molding is used in the manufacture of many popular plastic products such as bottle tops, syringes, remote control covers, and so on. This process involves placing the molten material in the mold where it cools and forms a solid final product. Injection molding is known for its efficiency, accuracy, and ability to produce parts of precise sizes for a wide variety of products commonly used in our daily lives. In addition, it is also used for large-scale applications such as car body parts. In particular, injection molding is used where thousands or millions of uniform parts must be molded.

          </ul>
          <h2>V. Cost Analysis</h2>
          <h3>Cost factors for prototype tooling</h3>
          <p>
            The factors that affect the total cost of prototype tooling are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design complexity: The cost of prototyping becomes high with more complex designs. Therefore, design complexities become crucial factors for the cost of tooling. It is much less for simple geometries and very high for complex designs.</li>
            <li>Size: Larger prototypes use more materials for prototyping and are therefore more expensive.</li>
            <li>Materials: The type of material used for prototyping significantly impacts the cost. Using high-quality materials like steel or aluminum may be more expensive than using plastic.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cost factors for injection molding</h3>
          <p>
            The cost of injection molding depends on several factors, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Order volume: Order volume is the most crucial factor for injection molding production. The cost per production is very low if the order volume is very high.</li>
            <li>Part complexity: Complex parts require more time and effort to manufacture and are therefore more expensive.</li>
            <li>Materials used: The type of material used for injection molding can significantly impact the cost.</li>
            <li>Equipment cost: The cost of equipment for injection molding can vary greatly. This is a one-time investment cost. Professional industrial injection molding equipment costs between $50,000 and $200,000.</li>
            <li>Labor costs: Most of the processes in injection molding are fully automated. However, costs like setup costs, repair costs, and operator costs come into play, resulting in an increment in overall cost.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Comparative cost analysis</h3>
          <p>When comparing the cost-effectiveness between prototype tooling and injection molding, prototype tooling becomes more cost-effective for small production runs and rapid prototyping due to its lower initial setup costs and no extra labor costs. However, prototype tooling cost increases with design complexity and part size increase. In contrast, injection molding shines in mass production scenarios with lower per-unit production costs for larger order volumes. Although initial setup costs are high and extra labor costs come into play, the total cost per unit is very low compared to a single prototyped unit. Therefore, injection molding is a superior choice if the order volume is high. </p>

           <h2>VI. Time Efficiency</h2>
          <h3>Lead time for prototype tooling</h3>
          <p>The strategy for rapid tooling is to make a less durable tool that is engineered for a much shorter life than a conventional tool. This allows toolmakers to work with less expensive materials and faster manufacturing processes, reducing waste. This is why rapid tooling has a shorter production cycle because of the faster manufacturing speed.</p>
          
          <h3>Lead time for injection molding</h3>
          <p>Injection molding is known for its longer lead times, typically taking 5-7 weeks to manufacture tooling and an additional 2-4 weeks to produce and ship parts. This longer time is because the molds need careful design and testing, which can take several months. Any changes in design further add to the turnaround time.</p>
          
          <h3>Comparative time analysis</h3>
          <p>Prototype tooling is used for shorter life spans with less expensive materials and faster processes. This results in a shorter production cycle. In contrast, injection molding needs mold design and testing, which leads to longer lead times, taking several months from tooling to final parts. Any design changes further extend the process.</p>
          
          <h2>VII. Material Selection and Flexibility</h2>
          <h3>Materials commonly used in prototype tooling</h3>
          <p>Prototype tooling also offers compatibility with many plastics. However, it's crucial to note that abrasive materials such as glass-filled nylon can cause mold wear, which shortens the tool's life. Careful consideration is essential when working with such materials.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Aluminum Al 7075;</li>
            <li>Carbon steel C45, C50;</li>
            <li>Semi harden Steel P20;</li>
            <li>High polishing steel NAK 80;</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Materials commonly used in injection molding</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Semi-harden steel 718, 2083, 8407, H13, etc.;</li>
            <li>Heat treatment is needed;</li>
            <li>High polishing steel NAK 80, S136;</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Flexibility in material choice for each method</h3>
          <p>In prototype tooling, the method aims to finish production with the shortest lead time such that the part produced functions as intended. Tool life isn’t a crucial factor here, so the mold can be made using a wide range of plastics and soft metals. However, in injection molding, the mold has to withstand multiple production cycles under high pressure and temperature, making tool life a crucial factor. Therefore, injection molds are made from semi-hardened steel like 718, 2083, 8407, H13, etc.</p>
          
          <h2>VIII. Complexity and Design Freedom</h2>
          <h3>How prototype tooling handles complex designs</h3>
          <p>Rapid tooling provides greater design flexibility and the ability to quickly incorporate design changes. Utilizing 3D printing and other cutting-edge rapid prototyping techniques allows for the effortless creation of intricate details, customized features, and complex geometries.</p>
          
          <h3>How injection molding handles complex designs</h3>
          <p>Injection molding can handle complex designs once the production mold is set up. However, creating or modifying an injection mold can be a time-consuming and costly process, which may limit design changes during the production phase.</p>
          
          <h3>Comparison in terms of design constraints</h3>
          <p>Flexible and quick design changes have been made possible by 3D printing and rapid prototyping. This allows prototype tooling methods to offer greater freedom in creating intricate, customized, and complex designs. In contrast, injection molding can produce complex designs, but the time and cost associated with mold setup and modifications can restrict design changes during production.</p>
          
          <h2>IX. Quality and Precision</h2>
          <h3>Quality considerations in prototype tooling</h3>
          <p>Prototype tooling creates prototypes that are slightly less precise compared to other tooling methods. Its main purpose is to create a product that functions as intended rapidly and cost-effectively. Prototype tooling often uses materials that may not be as durable and resistant to chemicals and wear. As a result, the prototypes may exhibit minor variations and surface imperfections, making quality, surface finishes, and textures less critical.</p>
          
          <h3>Quality considerations in injection molding</h3>
          <p>Injection molding is known for its exceptional precision and consistency. It excels in producing parts with minimal variation, ensuring tight tolerances and uniformity. Injection molding's ability to maintain consistent dimensions and high-quality finishes is crucial for applications where product quality and precision are paramount, such as medical devices or automotive components.</p>
          
          <h3>Comparative quality analysis</h3>
          <p>Injection molding stands out over prototype tooling in precision and consistency, producing parts with minimal variation and superior quality. In contrast, prototype tooling is designed for rapid and cost-effective prototyping, where some sacrifices are made in precision and surface quality. Injection molding is the better choice if a quality finish is a priority despite lead time and cost.</p>
          
          <h2>X. Scalability</h2>
          <h3>Scalability options in prototype tooling</h3>
          <p>Prototype tooling is limited in terms of scalability. It is excellent for small-batch production and rapid prototyping. However, it may not be the most efficient choice for scaling up to mass production due to the need for new molds and tooling adjustments.</p>
          
          <h3>Scalability options in injection molding</h3>
          <p>Injection molding is highly scalable once the production mold is in place. It can accommodate large production runs with minimal per-unit production costs.</p>
          
          <h3>Which is better for scaling up production?</h3>
          <p>Injection molding is better suited for scaling up production due to its high scalability. It accommodates large production runs efficiently and cost-effectively, while prototype tooling may not be as efficient for mass production due to the need for new molds and adjustments.</p>
          
<h2>XI. Case Studies</h2>
          
          <h3>Case Study: Prototype Tooling in Artificial Photosynthesis Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Innovation and product development often demand rapid tooling and flexible solutions. One of the real-world examples of this is the utilization of prototype tooling in the development of artificial photosynthesis technology as demonstrated by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP).
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge they faced was to fabricate optical components swiftly for use in an artificial photosynthesis prototype. Traditional optical fabrication methods were very time-consuming and impractical for prototyping. Also, their need was for rapid design-to-part cycles and the capacity for quick design modifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team explored three different mold fabrication methods: CNC machining of plastic, CNC machining of aluminum, and 3D printing of plastic. Each method offered its own advantages and challenges. Notably, 3D printing was the most promising result as it allowed for rapid tooling production and could serve as "bridge tooling" while waiting for a hardened steel mold to be designed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prototype tooling and injection molding each have their own advantages in product development. In the first case study, we learned that prototype tooling using soft mold tools allowed designers to iterate their designs rapidly and cost-effectively, though they had to compromise the quality of the mold. In contrast, the second study showed us the importance of injection molding in manufacturing at a large scale. Injection molding successfully produced a large number of lenses for various industries with precision and high quality.
          </p>

          <h2>XII. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Prototype tooling excels in rapid design iterations and cost-effective prototyping for small batches with a wide range of material choices. However, it sacrifices some durability and precision. Injection molding stands out in mass production with consistent quality, tight tolerances, and scalability, although it demands higher initial costs and longer lead times.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should choose prototype tooling for rapid prototyping, small-batch production, and quick design changes. Injection molding should be the preferred choice when scalability, precision, and consistent quality are essential in large productions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We suggest carefully considering your project's scale, budget, and quality requirements when deciding between prototype tooling and injection molding to ensure the most suitable manufacturing approach for your product development needs.

          <h2>1.	Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Injection molding is an old, effective, and one of the leading processes involved in manufacturing the complex product. It enables the mass production of complex shapes with high efficiency and optimum costs. It’s a widely implemented technique of the manufacturing process, and integral to the production of products in our daily life. The injection molding enables production of the large numbers of parts with greater accuracy and in a short time from the multi-cavity tools. It involves the process of heating the polymer materials and then injecting the melted molten materials into the mold under high pressure. The injection molding is a process with high repetitions, which means that all the products produced will be identical i.e., convenient for the consistent production and in large volume. This fast and intensive process involves high pressure and heat for the injection of the molten materials. It uses popular materials like thermoplastics (ABS, PS, PE, PC, PP or TPU). It is a complex process with many variables which impact the overall expenditure of the project. Factors like the complexity of the mold design, type of material used, volume produced, and geographic conditions make the injection molding complex. The businesses of the competitive market of today’s era need efficient and consistent cost implementation in their market, which shows that knowledge of injection molding is paramount. This article focuses on the wide world of injection molding costs, providing a detailed breakdown that enables businesses to make the right decision and optimize their production processes.

          <h2>2.	Fixed Costs in Injection Molding</h2>
          <p>
            Fixed costs of injection molding involve various components that are consistent and do not change with the production level over a period. There are multiple cost drivers for injection molding, out of which the fixed costs are the one that influences the other cost as well. Moreover, the overall financial feasibility of the injection molding is determined by the fixed costs.
          </p>

          <h3>Machinery Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Fundamentally, machinery cost plays a significant role in fixed expenses. Injection molding requires specialized machinery equipment, which involves considerable initial investment. The cost required for the purchase and maintenance of the injection molding machine must be considered in the fixed cost. The complexity and capabilities of the machines significantly make the machine's price different in the market. The machine required for a certain firm should carefully consider its production requirements and budget capacity to select the most suitable machines to mitigate long-term costs. The machine for injection molding ranges from smaller desktop injection molding machines suitable for the in-house business to large industrial injection molding machines that are utilized by large manufacturers. The production of low volumes of parts by injection molding is most effective with desktop injection molding machines and its cost varies around $350-$500. The large production requires large industrial injection machines which cost anywhere from $50,000-$200,000. These large machines require skilled labor, maintenance, and monitoring.
          </p>

          <h3>Facility Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Secondly, facility costs are another component of the fixed costs in injection molding. Facility costs generally refer to the expenses associated with the utilities, infrastructure, rental facilities, and space required for the injection molding facility to be operated. The facility costs are driven by the size and location of the injection molding area. Although the size and location differ for different firms it will be a fixed cost for each firm. There are some mostly considerable facility costs which are rent, utilities i.e., electricity, water, etc., suitable environment conditions, timely maintenance and repairs, security, property taxes, and many more. These all-facility costs differ for different places.
          </p>

          <h3>Labor Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Next, the labor cost is also the part of the fixed cost. But, most of the part of injection molding relies on automation. The process involved in injection molding i.e., CNC machining is operated by Computer Numerical Controlled software, while 3D printing is operated by its software, and also relies on characteristics of the CAD design to produce the mold, EDM machine also runs automatically and further the injection molding also possess automated process. So, the labor costs involved in injection molding are listed below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Setup Costs:</strong> The setup labor cost comprises all the time taken by the labor to configure the equipment to manufacture the mold and finalized product. For example, while making the molds, some setup of tooling is required which involves the operator’s time.</li>
            <li><strong>Repair Costs:</strong> As injection molding is the mechanical process consisting the various mechanical and electrical equipment, it involves repair and maintenance which requires labor.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring Costs:</strong> Although all the processes involved in injection molding are automized, there are equipment operators who are focused on monitoring the injection molding processes to ensure quality and inventory control.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While producing the product in-house, these all costs are calculated into labor costs. The wage cost for the labor varies with location but will remain the part of fixed cost for the injection molding industry. Furthermore, the method of cost estimation for the labor costs in injection molding is simplified below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Determining the number of operators required for the company.</li>
            <li>Calculating the labor working hours.</li>
            <li>Determining the labor rate per hour.</li>
            <li>Calculating the total labor costs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Licensing and Compliance Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Lastly, the licensing and compliance costs are crucial for injection molding. Injection companies must address the requirements of the concerned authorities and claim the license and all the required permits to operate the injection molding industry legally. The licensing and compliance come under the fixed costs considering the costs of business license, quality standard compliances, environmental permits, insurance, legal and consulting fees, taxes, occupational safety and health administration compliances, registration of the company, etc. Moreover, the consent to establish and consent to operate requires all the mentioned documents which fees are fixed for the injection molding industry.
          </p>

          <h2>3.	Variable Costs in Injection Molding</h2>
          <p>
            Variable costs in injection molding consist of different essential factors that ultimately impact the overall cost of production. The factors mentioned for the variable cost includes all the material cost, energy consumption, 
          </p>

          <h3>Material Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Materials cost is one of the active elements of the variable costs in injection molding. The type and amount of the materials used in the injection molding determine the production cost. The raw material cost is the sum of the cost of storage, the cost of labor used, the loss of interest in capital, etc. There are widely used varieties of plastic used for injection molding whose use depends on the requirements of the final parts, including ABS, PS, PE, PC, PP, or TPU. The cost required for the purchase of the materials for the molds depends on the material chosen. For example, if we use high-grade plastic resin, it will increase the material cost but will result in a quality product. The material cost is determined by the model’s design, the material for molding chosen, and the amount of materials required for the injection molding process.
          </p>

          <h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
          <p>
            Energy consumption by the injection molding process is also one of the crucial element variable costs. It is the amount of energy required to convert the raw materials into the product, which requires a sufficient amount of energy to heat the molds and inject the material. The energy consumption differs with different factors and cost also varies with the change in energy consumption. Energy consumption management is a key element in managing the efficient cost of injection molding. As an example, applying the optimized heating systems and automatically switching off the heating in idle conditions will reduce energy consumption further the cost will be reduced. Furthermore, different elements will help to estimate the cost of the energy consumption in injection molding i.e., machine size and efficiency, total running time, energy tariff, etc. The cost of energy for injection molding varies with different machine sizes. A larger injection molding machine will consume more energy and the production costs will be higher for larger machines.
          </p>
		<p>The energy consumption cost of the injection molding can be calculated using the following relation:</p>
<li>Energy cost=Total Energy Consumption (kWh)×Energy Rate ($/kWh)</li>
<p>The energy consumption data are gathered from all the appliances used in injection molding and then multiplied with the energy rate to calculate the energy cost.
</p>
          <h3>Maintenance cost</h3>
          <p>
           Maintenance cost is another key element in the variable costs of injection molding. The equipment of the injection molding requires monitoring and timely maintenance for the efficient running of the machine. Regular maintenance, cleaning, lubrication of the parts, monitoring of the system, and replacement of the parts are the main components to bear the maintenance cost. The timely maintenance will help to reduce the maintenance cost and reduce the overall cost. However, lack of maintenance will lead the machine to breakdown and costly downtime and also lead to production delays</p>
	<p>Overhead costs consist of various indirect expenses that do not deal with the production part which include labor, rent, depreciation cost, insurance, and general and administrative costs but that are still part of the injection molding process. For the support in the operation of injection molding, a company may have to allocate a portion of its office space and administrative staff salaries, and these overhead costs contribute to the overall variable cost of injection molding.</p>
	<h2>4. The Cost of Mold Design and Tooling</h2>
          <p>
            The complexity and material of mold are the driving factors in the cost of injection molding. The creation of the mold and development of the product through injection molding is a complex process. Different factors cause the complexity in injection molding like material selection, mold design, mold fabrication, tooling maintenance, part design, environment, and many more. The certain complexities that arise in the mold are listed below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Part size and geometry</li>
            <li>Cavity design</li>
            <li>Mold size</li>
            <li>Texture and surface finish</li>
            <li>Tolerance and precision</li>
            <li>Part volume and cavities</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="image-container">

          <p class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Pictorial representation of the complex mold design.</p>



          <p>
            Similarly, there are different materials for the mold. The selection of the right mold material will play a crucial part in the completion of successful injection molding material. Factors like heat resistance, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, cost, and thermal conductivity of the mold material play important roles in the selection of the right mold materials for injection molding. The materials used for injection molds include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Tool steel:</strong> Steel like P20, H13, and S136 are the tool steels used for molds in injection molding. These tool steels are generally used for applications ranging from small to large volumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stainless steel:</strong> The steel grades 420 and 440C are used as mold materials when there is concern about corrosion resistance. They are known for their good polishing properties and can result in a smooth surface finish.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aluminum:</strong> Aluminum molds are often used for low-volume production and rapid prototyping. The properties of aluminum, like good thermal conductivity and faster cooling, are beneficial, but the low durability and shorter lifespan limit its use to rapid prototyping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The material commonly used for injection molding is thermoplastic materials due to their unique features, as listed below with their features and costs:

          <p>
            Next, the mold design is crucial in determining how the final product looks, and a design fee is a must for the mold designer. For a successful molding project, a good mold design is essential. Developing a good mold design requires skilled and experienced manpower. The expertise and experience of the mold designer will determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the mold. Skilled manpower with the ability to optimize the design cost has a higher rate in the market. Depending on the size and complexity, design fees range from $100-$300 and sometimes higher. The roughly estimated hourly rate for the mold designer can be $30-$40. The price is reasonable as they could finish 10-12 simple injection molds in a working day, around 12 hours.
          </p>

	<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3: Pictorial representation of the complex mold design.</p>

          <p>
            Next, the manufacture of the mold is a crucial part of injection molding. This part involves the actual construction of the mold of the desired shape, with the involvement of precise machining and assembly. The mold cost depends on the size, complexity, and material selected for the molds. High volume and more complex structures of molds require more time and expertise, thus raising the cost as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mold looks like the negative of a photograph, which transfers the designed geometry and texture of the surface onto the injection-molded part. The manufacture of the injection mold requires a significant startup cost. A straightforward design, suitable for small-scale production amounts ranging from 1000 to 10,000 units, costs nearly $2000 to $5000. Similarly, large-scale molds typically capable of producing 100,000 units or above require a cost of around $100,000 or more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent times, 3D printing materials have enabled the manufacturing of molds for low-run injection molding, i.e., for 100 parts or less. The invention of 3D printing has made the production of small quantities more economically viable than in the past.
          </p>

          <div class="image-container">

	<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4: Pictorial representation of the complex mold design.</p>

          <p>
            The simplest type of mold manufactured is a straight-pull mold, consisting of two halves: the cavity (front part) and the core (back part). These types of molds are most chosen in the market due to their design ease and cost-effectiveness. Despite these advantages, straight-pull molds have certain limitations, such as the part must have 2-dimensional geometry on both sides.
          </p>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Articles/Article 12/Picture5.png" alt="Pictorial representation of the anatomy of the mold" class="img-fluid">
          </div>
	<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5: Pictorial representation of the anatomy of the mold.</p>

	<p>Further, for more complex geometries retractable side-action cores or other inserts are required. Side actions core enters the mold either from the top or bottom. The side action core must be used with more concern as it raises the cost rapidly. Injection molded parts consist of two sides i.e., A side facing the cavity and B side facing the core. The A side is responsible for the visual appearance and the surface is usually smooth according to the design specifications whereas the B side is the functional side usually hidden consisting of the structural elements.</p>

	<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7: Pictorial representation of the mold of steel in industry.</p>

	<p>Lastly, the mold lifespan has an impact on the overall cost of the injection molding. Mold with a long lifespan may have higher upfront costs but it can save the cost for a long time by reducing the problem of short-term maintenance, and timely replacement of the mold. Different factors could increase the lifespan of every mold i.e., regular maintenance, quality of materials, monitoring, etc.</p>
	 <h2>5. Production Volumes and Economies of Scale</h2>
          <p>
            The fundamental decision that the manufacturers of injection molding face is whether to manufacture products in large volume or small volume. The low-volume production of the products for small and medium-sized production businesses which can produce volumes usually up to 10,000 units or less in a month. The high-volume production in injection molding has a production capacity of 100,000 units in a month. Both low-volume and high-volume production have various advantages which are discussed below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The advantages of low-volume production are:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Less expensive tooling.</li>
              <li>It allows one to change the design quickly and have design flexibility.</li>
              <li>It can provide rapid access to the growing markets as it has a short production time.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>The advantages of high-volume production are:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>It can produce the parts in bulk amounts.</li>
              <li>It will reduce the unit costs and the cycle time for the product.</li>
              <li>The production is more often automated.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every manufacturer of injection molding should make the financial viability of their business strategy. The breakeven point will signify the volume of the production from the injection molding in which the total cost of production is equal to the total revenue. In injection molding, fixed costs like maintenance and overhead costs remain constant despite production volume. The variable cost changes with the number of productions. Thus, the breakeven point serves as the decision-making point for the manufacturer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, per-unit cost considerations are important to the economic analysis of injection molding. The low-volume production will lead to a higher per unit cost of the product manufactured from the injection molding while the high-volume production will lead to the reduction in per unit cost of the product.

          <h2>6. Quality and Precision Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            In injection molding, quality and precision considerations play a pivotal role. The consideration of both the quality of the product and the precision of the product encompasses different factors in manufacturing by injection molding. The tool design of the injection molding is the crucial part. The product is designed for manufacture in the best possible way the mold tool can make the product quality difference. For high quality, the product costs can exhibit in various forms, such as higher-grade materials, more advanced machinery, and experts. Although these considerations increase the production costs, they meet the customer expectations and ultimately preserve the reputation and market position.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, consistent product quality requires regular and intense inspection and quality assurance processes. The inspection and quality assurance costs are linked up with the manpower, equipment, and time of production. For example, an automobile company producing airbags should implement all the strategies and intense inspections to prevent damage to passenger safety. The costs employed with the advanced inspection tools and experts are added to overall production costs in injection molding. Hereby, the detection of defects early in the manufacturing i.e., inspection and quality assurance process will reduce the risk of company downfall and other possible legal liabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the error in injection molding when left unchecked, the future result will be vulnerable as it may lead to damage to the company's reputation and prestige. If the faulty product reaches the market and customers experience the poor product, it may tarnish the brand image. The priority on quality and precision in the injection molding process will reduce errors and financial loss for the company as well. Learning from real-world manufacturers can help in making decisions that balance quality and cost-effectiveness.
          </p>

Additionally, raw material costs, overhead costs, and energy consumption costs differ from one country to another, which also impacts the overall cost of the injection molding process. Manufacturers should conduct a comprehensive cost analysis to remain competitive in today's market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geographic considerations also drive the cost of shipping and logistics in the injection molding process. Key elements for manufacturing companies are markets and suppliers. Longer transportation distances result in increased shipping costs and longer lead times. Ease of supply to the market will automatically lead to a reduction in cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            In today's world, import/export taxes and tariffs are also significant cost factors for injection molding companies. Taxes between countries and tariffs on imported raw materials or finished products can change the cost structure of the injection molding operation.
          </p>

        <h4>Experimental Study of Mechanical Properties of Natural
Fiber Polymer Composite</h4>
	<p><i>University Scholar Conference (USC), Kathmandu University, Institute 
of Physics (IOP) , 2024</i> <Strong> (Under Review) </strong><p>
        <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Numerous studies and research projects have been conducted to develop
natural fiber polymer composites. The researcher and engineers develop a composite
by reinforcing natural fiber with a polymer that exhibits the desired mechanical
properties. The experiment determines the composite’s mechanical properties, such as
tensile, compression, flexural, and impact strength. This paper presents the
experimental study of the natural fiber-reinforced composite, where hemp and jute
fibers were reinforced with epoxy polymer as the test specimens for the experiment.
The primary approach involved fabricating composite samples with fiber-weight
fractions and matrix compositions. Then the appropriate sample is experimented with
for its tensile strength, compression strength, and impact strength. Another property of
the composite&#39;s the composite&#39;s water absorption was investigated through a water
absorbability test. Key results show that composites containing a 30% weight fraction
of natural hemp fiber demonstrated promising mechanical properties. This composite
showed a tensile strength of 50 MPa, a compression strength of 55.6 N/m 2 , an impact
strength of 58.9 kJ/m 2 , and a water absorbability of 7%. These results may offer
valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of natural fiber composites, which can
be used to optimize material design and engineering applications. Understanding the
limitations and strengths of these composites allows for informed decision-making in
selecting appropriate materials for specific engineering projects.</p>

conventional textile material can be upcycled to structural composite of high-end
application. In this project we carried out an experimental study on the mechanical
behavior of a composite material made from upcycled natural fiber that can be used as
wind turbine blade application. We investigated various natural fiber alternatives and
matrix for the composite preparation. Our key finding was that the studied natural fiber
alone cannot be used as a structural material for wind turbine blade without prior
processing like chemical treatment and use of filler material. There were many challenges
we face during the project due to unavailability of the equipment for the mechanical
testing. However, we observe specimen with 30% of fiber weight fraction of natural
hemp has good mechanical property. This study provides some basic mechanical
properties of the composite material as well as limitation one has to face during the
experimentation process. This study valuable insight into conduction similar kind of
research such as development of sustainable material for engineering application.</p>

        <h4>Development of Hydrogen Production and Storage System for the Demonstrative use in the
Transportation Sector of Nepal</h4>
        <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The global energy demand is increasing as the population grows. The extensive research is going
on to assess diverse energy sources to fulfill the energy needs. Today major sources of energy for
transportation purposes are fossil fuels yet these are non-renewable sources of energy and
henceforth they are limited. The fossil fuels are the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
The wide-ranging research is being carried out to introduce innovative renewable technology yet
the greater part of them fails in delivering energy that fulfills the demand of the masses. The
renewable energy has the limitations of fluctuating production and storage. With the advancement
in technologies. Green Hydrogen can be a possible alternative for energy carrier to channel large
amount of renewable energy in the industry and transportation. Soon this technology will be
established in Nepal and it will need rigorous research for the technological acceptance. This study
presents a review of hydrogen production and storage technologies for the demonstrative purposes
in the transportation sector. The hydrogen value chain has an integrated technological system with
several parameters. A case of 5 kW Load demand to drive a fuel cell is taken as an reference.
Component sizing of compressed storage tank, compressor, buffer tank and electrolyzer is done.
Different parameter-based scenario models are developed for analyzing storage systems and
alkaline electrolyzer. Mathematical models for the parameters like energy demand, volume,
pressure, cell voltage, no. of cells, temperature, etc has been identified. Based on these models the
operation constrains of the electrolyzer is developed. A parameter-based model is further analyzed
for optimum storage sizing for the same power demand in end-use. The result of the models is
discussed. An optimized mathematical model is proposed that lays the foundation for system sizing
of the production and storage systems for the application in transportation sector.</p>

    <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Evaluating the Impact of Conical Angle and Inlet Velocity on Separation Efficiency and Pressure Drop in Cyclonic Pre-Dust Separators Using Eulerian and Lagrangian Models in OpenFOAM</h3>
    <div class="working-content">
      <div class="description" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
          This project involves a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study focused on optimizing the performance of cyclonic pre-dust separators. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of varying conical angles and inlet velocities on separation efficiency and pressure drop using OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD toolbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study employs both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to model fluid-particle interactions within the cyclone separator. The Eulerian model is used to simulate the continuous phase (airflow), while the Lagrangian model tracks the discrete phase (dust particles). These approaches are implemented in OpenFOAM to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent flow and to capture the trajectories and interactions of dust particles within the cyclone.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video on the right, the simulation results for a standard high-performance cyclone separator dimension are shown using the same MPPICFoam method. In this simulation, 10,000 parcels are supplied per second through the inlet for 10 seconds, and the results are calculated after 18 seconds of simulation. The physical properties of the dust particles are referenced from silica dust particles, providing realistic and applicable insights into the performance of the cyclone separator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The geometry of the cyclone separator is modeled in Fusion 360 and imported into OpenFOAM, where the mesh is generated using the snappyHexMesh utility. Boundary conditions are meticulously defined, with the inlet, outlet, walls, and collector surfaces tailored to simulate real-world conditions. Inlet velocities are varied across a range of values, and the conical angle of the separator is adjusted to determine its effect on separation efficiency and pressure drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study tracks particle collection efficiency using the discrete phase model, focusing on the effectiveness of dust particle trapping at the collector. The simulation results provide detailed insights into how different geometric configurations and flow conditions influence the overall performance of the cyclone separator.
        </p>
